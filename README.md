This project implements Simulated Annealing algorithm in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 2-opt local search. As a construction heuristic, the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used to construct an initial solution.

#Procedure
The following code runs in the terminal:
$ python runSA2opt.py filename,
where filename is the name of the snapshot file. For example, to implement the algorithm in berlin52.tsp the following command is executed:
$ python runSA2opt.py berlin52.tsp

#Results
After running the code the optimal route is printed as well as the distance table.
